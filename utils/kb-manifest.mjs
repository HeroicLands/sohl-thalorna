/**
 * The cross-package link manifest (#1446).
 *
 * Each package that publishes a web surface emits one file naming every note it
 * publishes, keyed by the canonical `type/shortcode` address and valued
 * `{ url, name }` — the same shape the knowledgebase already uses as its own
 * index value, so a foreign entry and a local one are interchangeable at the
 * point of use.
 *
 * The manifest exists to make one question decidable: when a link addresses
 * `creature-grkrahk` and this build has never heard of it, is that a typo or a
 * note belonging to another package? Before the manifest nothing in the syntax
 * answered that, so the dead-link guard had to be left off for the hyphen form
 * or correct content would fail the build (see `kb-wikilinks.mjs`). With every
 * package's manifest vendored, an address that resolves in none of them is a
 * typo, and the guard can be restored.
 *
 * `kethira` is deliberately absent. It ships only compendium packs, publishes
 * no pages, and nothing may depend on it — the module has to stay withdrawable
 * (see that repository's `CLAUDE.md`), which a manifest edge pointing into it
 * would quietly prevent.
 *
 * **An entry's address is relative to its own package's base** (#1465), never a
 * site-absolute path. Where a package is *mounted* is the consumer's knowledge,
 * held in {@link PACKAGE_BASE} and prefixed at resolve time — so moving a
 * package to another path or origin is one string per consumer rather than a
 * regenerated manifest, and an inbound link survives the move. A path recorded
 * in the manifest would not: it resolves, emits an `href`, and 404s, which is
 * the silent failure the manifest exists to end.
 */

 * manifest keys, every lookup — uses this instead, so no consumer has to know

 * Manifest format version.

 * renders, and 404s — so the version is what makes a stale vendored file an
 * error rather than a wrong link.
 *
 * Bumped to 4 by #1499: keys use the authored hyphen separator
 * (`thalorna-creature-grkrahk`) so a key *is* the address an author writes; an
 * item's documentation became an entry in its own right rather than a second
 * field; and entries gained `anchors`, mapping a note's named sections to the
 * full UUID each compiled to.
 *
 * Bumped to 3 by #1499: keys became **canonical** — fully qualified
 * `package/type/shortcode` rather than `type/shortcode` — and entries gained the
 * Foundry `uuid` / `docUuid` beside the web `path`. A v2 key read as a v3 one
 * addresses a package named after a type, so again the version is what turns a
 * stale vendored file into an error.
 *
 * Bumped to 5 by #1516: `path` became optional, so a package that ships
 * compendiums and publishes no site can still publish the Foundry addresses of
 * its documents — the mirror of an entry that has a `path` and no `uuid`.
