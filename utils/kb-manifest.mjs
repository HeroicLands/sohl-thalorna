/**
 * The cross-package link manifest (#1446).
 *
 * Each package that publishes a web surface emits one file naming every note it
 * publishes, keyed by the canonical `type/shortcode` address and valued
 * `{ url, name }` — the same shape the knowledgebase already uses as its own
 * index value, so a foreign entry and a local one are interchangeable at the
 * point of use.
 *
 * The manifest exists to make one question decidable: when a link addresses
 * `creature-grkrahk` and this build has never heard of it, is that a typo or a
 * note belonging to another package? Before the manifest nothing in the syntax
 * answered that, so the dead-link guard had to be left off for the hyphen form
 * or correct content would fail the build (see `kb-wikilinks.mjs`). With every
 * package's manifest vendored, an address that resolves in none of them is a
 * typo, and the guard can be restored.
 *
 * `kethira` is deliberately absent. It ships only compendium packs, publishes
 * no pages, and nothing may depend on it — the module has to stay withdrawable
 * (see that repository's `CLAUDE.md`), which a manifest edge pointing into it
 * would quietly prevent.
