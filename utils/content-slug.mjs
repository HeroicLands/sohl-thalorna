/**
 * The URL segment of a content note — derived from its name.
 *
 * Content notes carry no authored `slug`: it was a hand-maintained second
 * spelling of something already determined, free to drift from the page it
 * named. The URL is derived instead.
 *
 * It is derived from the **name**, deliberately not from the `shortcode`, even
 * though `(type, shortcode)` is unique by rule and would be a tempting key. A
 * shortcode is *identity*: it is referenced from saved world data — actions,
 * cohorts, expressions, archetypes, pack lookups — so binding the public URL to
 * it would make a cosmetic URL change into a data migration. A URL is
 * presentation, and it should read like one (`/creature/nusvorroth/`, not
 * `/creature/nsvrroth/`). Renames are what a URL must survive, and they do:
 * every change appends to the legacy-URL map, which emits a redirect.
 *
 * This is document identity, and it is deliberately **not** the same operation
 * as the other slug-shaped transforms in the build:
 *
 * - heading **anchor** slugs (`[[#some-heading]]`, `{#slug}`) — position within
 *   a page, in `utils/kb-wikilinks.mjs` and `utils/packs/journals.mjs`;
 * - pack **filename** slugs, in `utils/packs/build-compendiums.mjs`;
 * - `slugifyShortcode` in `src/utils/helpers.ts`, which runs the other way —
 *   suggesting a shortcode _from_ a name when an item is created.
 *
 * Plain ESM with no Foundry and no filesystem access, so it is unit-testable —
 * see `tests/build/content-slug.test.ts`.

/**
 * The URL segment for one content note.
 *
 * The name is **transliterated** before it is reduced, so an accented character
 * is carried across rather than dropped — dropping is what turned `Nüsvōrroth`
 * into `n-sv-rroth` and forced a hand-written slug. Ligatures expand the way a
 * reader would spell them out: `þ`→`th`, `æ`→`ae`, `œ`→`oe`, `ß`→`ss`, `ĳ`→`ij`,
 * `ﬁ`→`fi`, and eth (`ð`) follows the Icelandic convention of a bare `d`.
 *
 * Two reductions are ours rather than the transliterator's:
 *
 * - **apostrophes are removed**, not treated as separators (`Armorer's Kit` →
 *   `armorers-kit`), matching the URLs these pages already publish at;
 * - **a fraction keeps its digits together** — a vulgar fraction expands to
 *   `3/4`, and the solidus would otherwise split it into `3-4`, so a slash
 *   *between digits* is closed up (`Kûrbúl ¾-Helm` → `kurbul-34-helm`).
 *
 * @param {string | undefined} name - The note's display name (`name.full`),
 *   which a malformed note may not have at all.
 * @returns {string} The URL segment (never empty).
 * @throws {Error} When there is no name, or the name carries no URL-safe
 *   characters — either way the note cannot be addressed, which is a content
 *   error rather than something to paper over with a fallback.
