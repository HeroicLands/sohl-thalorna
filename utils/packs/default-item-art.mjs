/**
 * Default item artwork, keyed by item `type` — the single source of truth for
 * both the compendium builder (`utils/packs/items.mjs`, at build time) and the
 * runtime `SohlItem.getDefaultArtwork` override (fresh, ad-hoc-created items).
 *
 * Foundry's `Item.DEFAULT_ICON` is the white `icons/svg/item-bag.svg`, which is
 * invisible on the light Manuscript sheet and does not adapt to theme; every
 * SoHL item type instead defaults to a themed `systems/sohl/assets/icons/**`
 * SVG here (dark ink in light mode, cream in dark, via the build-time
 * adaptive-fill injection in `utils/svg-theme.mjs`).
 *
 * This module is deliberately **plain ESM** — no TypeScript, no `@src` aliases,
 * no Foundry — precisely so the plain-`node` pack scripts *and* the bundled TS
 * runtime can both import it. A `.ts` module could not be required by the build
 * scripts (they run under bare `node`, without the bundler that resolves the
 * `@src` alias and strips types). Keeping one map here is what prevents the
 * build-time and runtime defaults from drifting apart (issue #932 was exactly
 * that drift: the builder had a default, runtime did not).
 *
 * Paths are fully resolved (`systems/sohl/...`) — the served path both layers
 * need. If a new item type is added, add its default here.
