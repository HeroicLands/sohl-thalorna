/**
 * Is there any content to compile?
 *
 * The pack build's worst failure is not an error but a **success on nothing**: a
 * content tree that is absent or empty compiles zero documents, reports no
 * error, and ships compendiums that are simply empty. Nothing downstream
 * notices — the LevelDB packs are written, the deploy mirrors them, and the
 * defect surfaces as "my compendiums are blank" long after the build went green.
 *
 * `assets/content/` is committed source here, so an empty tree means a partial
 * or shallow checkout rather than a missing export. Either way it compiles
 * nothing. This counts what is actually there so the build can refuse.

/**
 * Count the Markdown notes below a content tree.

 * Only notes count. The per-pack folder manifests are not content, so a tree
 * holding nothing but manifests counts zero — which is correct, because it
 * compiles zero documents. Dot directories are skipped so stale editor caches
 * cannot make an empty tree look populated.
 *
 * @param {string} root - Absolute path to the content tree.
 * @returns {number} The number of `.md` notes, or 0 when the tree is absent.
