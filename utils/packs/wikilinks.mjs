/**
 * Wikilink resolution for the pack compilers.
 *
 * Content notes link to one another with wikilinks rather than file paths:
 *
 *   `[[type/shortcode|Text]]`   a document of that type
 *   `[[Text]]`                  an alias unique within the source's own type
 *   `[[type/shortcode#slug|T]]` a section (see below)
 *   `[[#slug|Text]]`            a section of the source note itself
 *   `[[doctype/shortcode|T]]`   an item's *documentation* (see below)
 *
 * The qualifier is the note's **type**, which with its shortcode is the system's
 * logical identity: `(type, shortcode)` is unique by rule (see the Shortcode
 * Integrity doc). It is deliberately not the note's directory — shortcodes are
 * unique per type, not per directory, so a directory qualifier would add nothing
 * to the address while breaking every inbound link the moment a note is refiled.
 *
 * The bare form is the same address with the qualifier left implicit: it resolves
 * against the aliases of the source's **own type**, so a `doc` reaches any other
 * `doc` by name wherever it is filed. Nothing narrower is consulted — a note's
 * directory and its `category` play no part in resolution. Where two notes of a
 * type legitimately share a name (a rules page and a user-guide page both called
 * "Gear"), the bare form is ambiguous and resolves to neither; the author writes
 * the full `[[type/shortcode|Text]]` form instead.
 *
 * At compile time each becomes a Foundry UUID enricher, addressed to the pack
 * that the target's type compiles into (see {@link packForType}), inside the
 * package this repository ships:
 *
 *   `@UUID[Compendium.sohl-thalorna.items.Item.<id>]{Text}`
 *   `@UUID[Compendium.sohl-thalorna.journals.JournalEntry.<id>.JournalEntryPage.<anchorId>]{Text}`
 *
 * **Every address is computed once, when the target is indexed** — see
 * {@link buildWikilinkIndex} — and a link is resolved by looking that value up.
 * Nothing here concatenates a prefix at the point of use: doing so in two
 * separate files is how every emitted link came to address the `sohl` system
 * from a repository that ships `sohl-thalorna` (#1498).
 *
 * Section links address a **JournalEntryPage**, because Foundry UUIDs cannot
 * target a position inside a page. A heading carrying `{#slug}` therefore starts
 * its own page, whose id is {@link anchorPageId} — derived from the note id and
 * the slug so that the link and the page agree without any shared state.
 *
 * **An anchor on an Item, an Actor or a Macro is a no-op** and is dropped. What
 * such a link does is open that document's **sheet** — not its documentation —
 * and a sheet has no sections to address. Only a JournalEntry link opens a
 * journal, at its first page or at the page an anchor names. An item's pages are
 * reached through its `doc<type>` counterpart, below.
 *
 * **Items and their documentation are two documents.** An item note compiles
 * into an item — and, separately, its prose compiles into a JournalEntry in the
 * journals pack (see {@link sohl.utils.packs.itemDocEntryId}). `skill/wpnc`
 * addresses the skill; the **virtual qualifier** `docskill/wpnc` addresses that
 * skill's documentation, and `docskill/wpnc#crafting` a page within it. Every
 * item type has a `doc<type>` counterpart, formed by prefix and never
 * enumerated; see {@link resolveItemDocType}. Without it a section link to an
 * item note produced a UUID against the *items* pack, which cannot hold a
 * JournalEntryPage, and dead-ended (#1362).
 *
 * **The two builds read the qualifier differently, by design.** In Foundry the
 * item and its documentation are separate documents in separate packs, so the
 * two qualifiers resolve to two different UUIDs. On the knowledgebase the item
 * note renders as a single page which *is* its documentation, so `doc<type>` and
 * `<type>` are aliases for the same URL and an anchor on either is an ordinary
 * in-page anchor. One authored link, correct in both.
 *
 * Plain ESM with no Foundry and no filesystem access, so it is unit-testable.

/**
 * Read a link target as a **qualified** `type-shortcode` reference, or report
 * that it is a bare alias instead.
 *
 * Two separators are accepted, and they are **not** interchangeable in how
 * confidently they mark a target as qualified:
 *
 * - **`type-shortcode`** — the canonical form (#1398). Obsidian reads `/` inside
 *   a wikilink as a *path* and resolves it against the vault's folders, so a
 *   slash-qualified link is a broken link in the editor where the content is now
 *   authored. A hyphen qualifies **only when what precedes it is a known type**:
 *   note names contain hyphens too (`Grukar-ahk`), and those must keep resolving
 *   as aliases. The split is at the **first** hyphen, so a shortcode may itself
 *   contain one (`trauma-self-pro` → `trauma` + `self-pro`).
 * - **`type/shortcode`** — the legacy form, still resolved so that a link
 *   written before the vault migrated does not silently die. A slash is
 *   *unconditionally* a qualifier: nothing else uses one, so an unknown type
 *   before it is an error rather than an invitation to try the alias index. The
 *   split is at the **last** slash, as it always was.
 *
 * @param {string} target - The link target, anchor already removed.
 * @param {Set<string>} types - Every type the content tree contains.
 * @returns {{type: string, shortcode: string, itemDoc: boolean,
 *   reason?: undefined} | {reason: "unknown-type"} | null}
