/**
 * Pack JSON generation — in-repo Markdown → per-entry JSON (build-only).
 *
 * Reads the authoritative content tree at `assets/content/` and compiles each
 * pack's entries to per-entry JSON under `build/packs-json/<pack>/`. The JSON is
 * a disposable build intermediate consumed by `build:compiledb` (which turns it
 * into the shipped LevelDB packs) — it is never committed.
 *
 * Each `*` compiler walks the whole content tree and selects its own entries by
 * frontmatter (`package: thalorna` + `type`), so routing is directory-agnostic: a
 * file lands in a pack because of its `type`, not its location. Folder
 * hierarchies are declared per pack in `assets/content/<singular>-folders.yaml`
 * and referenced from entry frontmatter via `sohl.folder: <id>`.
 *
 * This replaces the retired `packs:export` (vault → committed `_source/`); the
 * HeroicLands vault is no longer a build input at all. `assets/content/` is
 * *source*, authored here — not an export of anything (#1441).

 * — and almost all of those are defined by the **`sohl` package**, not this one.
 * The compiler resolves them against the notes it can see, and this repository
 * holds only `package: thalorna`, so every such reference is unresolvable: a
 * trial run compiled 145 actors while reporting 14,087 unresolved items, which
 * is a pack that builds green and is empty where it matters.
 *
 * Nothing regresses by leaving it out — the vault-export pipeline this replaced
 * never compiled actors either (its `PACK_CONFIGS` held `items` and `journals`
 * only), so the actors compendium has always shipped empty.
 *
 * Turning it on needs the `sohl` package's compiled items available as a
 * catalog at build time. `actors.mjs` and `actor-folders.yaml` are kept in
 * place so that, once they are, re-enabling is this entry and nothing else.
