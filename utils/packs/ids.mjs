/**
 * Deterministic document ids, derived by hashing rather than stored.
 *
 * Several pack-build passes must agree on an id without being able to see each
 * other's output — the items pass and the journals pass on an item doc's entry
 * id, a section link and the page it addresses on that page's id. They agree by
 * deriving the id from the same inputs, so the derivation has to be reachable
 * from every one of them.
 *
 * That is why this is its own module and not part of `helpers.mjs`: link
 * resolution needs it, and `helpers.mjs` imports the link resolver. A leaf with
 * no local imports can be depended on from anywhere without a cycle.
