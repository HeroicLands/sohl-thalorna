/**
 * **Item docs** — an item's prose compiled as a JournalEntry, with the item
 * keeping only a pointer to it.
 *
 * An item note's body describes what the thing *is*. That is documentation, and
 * documentation belongs in the journals pack, so each item note compiles into a
 * JournalEntry and the item's `system.docHtml` becomes nothing but a `@UUID`
 * link to that entry's first page — the description-as-pointer convention
 * (#1356), which {@link sohl.utils.descriptionLinkTarget} recognises and
 * Display Description follows.
 *
 * The prose then exists once. Previously every actor carrying an item carried
 * its own copy of that item's description: 7.59 MB across the actors pack, of
 * which only 133 KB was distinct text (#1348). Nothing about actors changes —
 * they embed whatever the item carries, and what the item carries is now a link.
 *
 * **Two passes, no shared state.** The items pass writes the pointer; the
 * journals pass writes the entry it points at. Neither can see the other's
 * output, so both derive the same ids from the item note's own id — the same
 * technique {@link anchorPageId} uses to let a section link and its page agree.
 *
 * Plain ESM with no Foundry and no filesystem access, so it is unit-testable.
