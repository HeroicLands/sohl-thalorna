/**
 * Wikilink resolution for the website content build (#1451).
 *
 * The same authored links the pack compilers turn into Foundry `@UUID` enrichers
 * (see `utils/packs/wikilinks.mjs`) become site-local hrefs here:
 *
 *   `[[type-shortcode|Text]]`      → `[Text](/thalorna/section/slug/)`
 *   `[[Text]]`                     → the same, via a type-scoped alias
 *   `[[type-shortcode#slug|Text]]` → `[Text](/thalorna/section/slug/#slug)`
 *   `[[#slug|Text]]`               → `[Text](#slug)`
 *
 * The published *section* is not always the type: prose pages (`type: doc`)
 * route by their `category`, so `doc-companies` lands on `/thalorna/company/`.
 * The caller supplies that mapping already resolved, in the index it builds —
 * so this module never learns the `/thalorna` prefix, and the same rules serve
 * any package that publishes a path.
 *
 * Vendored from the SoHL system repository's `utils/kb-wikilinks.mjs` so the two
 * builds resolve an authored link identically; see `utils/packs/README.md` for
 * how the vendored tree is kept diffable against upstream.

/**
 * Rewrites the wikilinks in a markdown body as site-local markdown links.
 *
 * A target is looked up case-insensitively: first as an alias scoped to the
 * source's own **type** (`ctx.typeAlias`, keyed `type|alias`) — a note's
 * directory and `category` play no part — then in the site-wide `ctx.index`
 * (keyed by the unambiguous `section/slug` and `type/shortcode`, plus
 * name/filename/slug fallbacks).
 *
 * An unresolved target fails the build only when it is a genuine intra-package
 * problem — an ambiguous alias, or a qualified `prefix/key` whose prefix is a
 * real section or content type. Anything else is treated as an external
 * reference and rendered as plain text — until every package's manifest is
 * present, after which any `type-shortcode` address resolving nowhere fails
 * too. Failures are collected in `ctx.errors`.
 *
 * @param {string} body - The markdown body.
 * @param {object} ctx - `{ index, typeAlias, collide, typeCollide, sections,
 *   contentTypes, foreign, manifestsComplete, type, errors, src }`. `foreign`
 *   is the cross-package manifest index (#1446); `manifestsComplete` says
 *   whether every linkable package is accounted for. Together they decide
 *   whether an unresolved address is a typo or a package merely absent.
 *   An optional `onResolve(hit)` is called once per link that resolves, which
 *   is how the caller collects the page-to-page link graph without parsing the
 *   wikilinks a second time — and so without a second rule that could disagree
 *   with this one about what resolves.
 * @returns {string} The body with wikilinks rewritten.
