/**
 * Wikilink resolution for the website content build (#1451).
 *
 * The same authored links the pack compilers turn into Foundry `@UUID` enrichers
 * (see `@heroiclands/package-build/engine/wikilinks`) become site-local hrefs
 * here:
 *
 *   `[[type-shortcode|Text]]`      → `[Text](/thalorna/section/slug/)`
 *   `[[Text]]`                     → the same, via a type-scoped alias
 *   `[[type-shortcode#slug|Text]]` → `[Text](/thalorna/section/slug/#slug)`
 *   `[[#slug|Text]]`               → `[Text](#slug)`
 *
 * The published *section* is not always the type: prose pages (`type: doc`)
 * route by their `category`, so `doc-companies` lands on `/thalorna/company/`.
 * The caller supplies that mapping already resolved, in the index it builds —
 * so this module never learns the `/thalorna` prefix, and the same rules serve
 * any package that publishes a path.
 *
 * A sibling of the SoHL system repository's `utils/kb-wikilinks.mjs`: both read a
 * link's qualifier with the shared toolchain's own rule, so the two builds
 * resolve an authored link identically.

 * is not markdown and is never walked by either, so a link written in one is
 * copied through verbatim and reaches the reader as literal `[[…]]` text, in
 * whatever the theme renders that field as (an infobox row, a description, a
 * card subtitle). Nothing downstream notices: the value is a valid string, the
 * page builds, and the defect is visible only to someone who looks at it — which
 * is how the Grukarhölm polity infobox came to show its Government row as
 * brackets while the same link, twice in the body, resolved correctly.
 *
 * So the form is refused rather than resolved. Resolving it would mean choosing
 * an output syntax for a field whose renderer is unknown to this build — a
 * markdown link is inert in a Hugo template that prints the value as text, and
 * an `<a>` is unusable in one that escapes it — and would quietly bless an
 * authoring habit that the pack build has no way to honour at all. Frontmatter
 * carries data; a link belongs in prose.

 * Values are read from the *parsed* frontmatter, so a `[[` inside a YAML comment
 * is not a hit, and every hit can be named by the path a reader would look at.
