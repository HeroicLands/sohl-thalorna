# Appearance {#appearance}

The ground trembles as the massive stone construct rises, its form an assemblage of layered rocks and boulders fused into something approaching humanoid shape. The exterior is armored in thick stone plates, and magical runes glow faintly across the surface. The eyes are deep-set, glowing like molten lava, burning with unwavering dedication and purpose. You are looking at something created from stone and sorcery, given movement and will through magical binding.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Rockhide Golems are engineered for defense and brute force, standing 10-12 feet tall and composed of fused stone and rock. These relentless guardians protect valuable treasures and important locations throughout ancient ruins and fortifications. Adventurers encounter them when approaching guarded sites or attempting theft from protected locations.
