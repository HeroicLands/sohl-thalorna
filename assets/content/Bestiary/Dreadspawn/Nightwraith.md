# Appearance {#appearance}

The darkness above you ripples with motion—a shadow that moves against the shadows themselves. Then you hear it: not the flap of wings but something worse, a wet, clicking chirp that seems to come from everywhere at once. The temperature plummets as an enormous winged shape passes overhead, blocking out even the starlight, and you catch the reek of blood and cave-rot. Two points of sickly crimson luminescence fixate on you from above—eyes that see you more clearly in utter darkness than you can see in daylight. Fangs the length of fingers curve downward, and you hear the thrash of leathery wings as the creature wheels for another pass, and the sound of its hunger is a thousand screaming voices condensed into a single, dripping maw.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Nightwraiths are apex predators of the darkness, corrupted giant bats whose forms have been twisted by magical or infernal forces into weapons of terrible efficiency. They roam the night skies, deep cave systems, and the spaces below ground where no natural light reaches, hunting with ruthless precision. Unlike their natural ancestors, Nightwraiths possess an intelligence that borders on cunning, and they seem to take pleasure in the hunt itself rather than merely feeding. They are said to gather in large roosts in caverns of particular depth or remoteness, and traveling merchants have learned to fear the arrival of dusk and the sound of their chittering calls.

## Presentation

A Nightwraith measures 15 to 20 feet from wingtip to wingtip, with a muscular, emaciated frame that seems half-starved despite its constant feeding. Its skin is a sickly, translucent gray-black like rotted leather stretched over bone, with visible veins and sinews pulsing beneath. Its wings are vast and membranous, webbed with a material that seems to absorb light rather than reflect it, and they emit a wet, chittering sound when they flex. Its face is a nightmare of adaptation—eyes like burning coals set above a mouth of terrible proportions, lined with fangs of fearsome length and sharpness. Tufts of bristling fur run along its spine and the upper edges of its wings. The creature emits a constant, ultrasonic clicking that humans can feel but barely hear, and the air around it carries the overpowering stench of blood and corrupted flesh.

## Key Behaviors

Nightwraiths are primarily crepuscular and nocturnal, becoming active as darkness falls and hunting throughout the night until dawn drives them to roost. They are colonial creatures, returning to large communal roosts in deep caves or cavern systems where dozens or even hundreds may gather during the day. At night, they disperse to hunt, each creature claiming its own territory but often overlapping with others. They are drawn to areas of high prey density—particularly settlements where livestock or humans might be found. A Nightwraith’s hearing is extraordinarily sensitive; it can detect the heartbeat of a human at considerable distance and will stalk wounded or sick prey with patient deliberation.

## Combat Strategy

A Nightwraith attacks from above and behind whenever possible, attempting to rake prey with its fangs and claws before ascending beyond reach. It relies on speed and superior agility to avoid damage, making multiple passes rather than committing to prolonged melee. Against multiple opponents or heavily armored foes, it attempts to separate and isolate targets, dragging one away from the group where it can finish the kill without interference. The creature is intelligent enough to recognize when it faces an overwhelmingly superior threat and will retreat to its roost if severely wounded, though it may circle and wait for an opportunity to renew the attack once its opponent shows signs of fatigue.

## Attack Methods

### Blood-Draining Bite

The Nightwraith dives from above, attempting to drive its elongated fangs into exposed flesh and anchoring itself while it feeds. Victims lose blood rapidly and begin to weaken from blood loss and the creature’s parasitic venom.

### Raking Talons

The creature’s claws are nearly as formidable as its fangs, used to rake prey during aerial passes or to hold a victim immobile while it feeds.

### Sonic Screech

The Nightwraith’s ultrasonic vocalizations can be focused into a devastating assault that disorients and dazes all creatures in a cone before it, disrupting spellcasting and balance alike.

## Special Abilities

### Echolocation Mastery

The Nightwraith navigates and hunts with perfect precision in complete darkness, its echolocation revealing the world to it in perfect detail even when totally blind. It can perceive creatures by heartbeat, breath, and body heat with accuracy that rivals magical sight.

### Nocturnal Predation

In darkness or low light, the Nightwraith’s movement and attacks are enhanced, and its perceptiveness is magnified. Creatures attempting to track or target it in darkness suffer significant disadvantage.

### Blood Hunger

Once the Nightwraith has tasted blood, it enters a state of heightened aggression and focus on that particular victim, pursuing it with relentless determination. A bleeding target cannot easily escape or hide from the creature.

## Additional Information

Bright light is the Nightwraith’s primary weakness—sustained illumination causes it physical pain and forces it to retreat. Daylight is nearly unbearable; a Nightwraith caught in direct sunlight will flee desperately to the nearest darkness. Fire is equally effective, not only harming the creature but overwhelming its sensitive senses and disrupting its echolocation. Roosts can sometimes be eliminated by smoke or by destroying the cavern entrances, trapping the creatures in daylight where they slowly weaken. The guano accumulated in Nightwraith roosts is extraordinarily valuable to alchemists and tends to accumulate in toxic, crystalline forms that can be harvested. Some desperate communities have attempted to negotiate with Nightwraith colonies by providing regular sacrificial livestock, reducing human predation in exchange for food—a practice viewed with deep moral ambiguity by most societies.

## Lineage Notes

_The following notes are inherited from the original lineage description._

Above you the darkness ripples with motion, a shadow moving against shadows themselves. Then you hear it—a wet, clicking chirp from everywhere at once. The temperature plummets, and you realize the thing has already marked you by the beat of your heart.

## Description

The nightwraith measures fifteen to twenty feet from wingtip to wingtip—a corrupted giant bat with emaciated frame and wings of membrane that seem to absorb light. It possesses bioluminescent eyes burning with sickly luminescence and an aura of wrongness that affects the environment around it.

## Key Behaviors

Nightwraiths are colonial creatures, returning to large communal roosts in deep caves during the day and dispersing to hunt throughout the night until dawn drives them to rest. They are drawn to areas of high prey density and can detect the heartbeat of humans at considerable distance.

## Relations

Nightwraiths gather in colonies in deep caves and hunt settlements regularly. Humans regard them as abominations to be eliminated when encountered.

## Special Abilities

### Echolocation Hunting

Nightwraiths navigate and hunt with perfect precision in complete darkness through echolocation, perceiving creatures by heartbeat and body heat.

### Roost Regeneration

Nightwraiths return to their roosts to rest and heal, demonstrating resistance to conventional damage sources between hunts.

### Parasitic Venom

Nightwraiths emit ultrasonic vocalizations and drain blood with parasitic venom that paralyzes prey on contact.
