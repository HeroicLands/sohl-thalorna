# Appearance {#appearance}

The tap-tap-tap of claw on stone precedes recognition — a rhythmic, eerie clicking that sends primal warning up your spine. The creature steps into view on powerful hind legs, its form undeniably reptilian: sleek, muscular, and covered in mottled green-brown scales that shift with each movement. Jagged bony ridges run the length of its spine, glinting with an ominous light. The yellow eyes are unblinking and intelligent, and as it tilts its head with unsettling fluidity, the mouth opens to emit a sound that is part hiss, part something more — a clicking, chittering vocalization that seems designed to unnerve prey. You notice the claws on each foot curve upward in deadly arcs, clearly specialized for slashing and eviscerating.

# Dossier {#dossier}

The Thornback Raptor is a bipedal reptilian predator standing 5-6 feet tall, found in forests, jungles, and ruins across warm and temperate regions. These pack hunters are sophisticated coordinators that use psychological warfare alongside physical prowess to overcome prey. Adventurers encounter them primarily while exploring ruins, traveling through jungles, or camping near areas where the creatures hunt.

## Presentation

The Thornback Raptor is a sleek, muscular predator covered in mottled scales ranging from green to brown to gray, providing excellent camouflage in jungle and forest environments. The distinctive feature is the row of jagged bony ridges running along the spine from neck to tail. The head is proportionally large with forward-facing yellow eyes suited for predatory vision. The mouth contains rows of small, sharp teeth designed for precision cutting. The body is built for speed and agility over raw strength. The legs are powerful and positioned for bipedal locomotion, ending in three-toed feet with curved claws similar to modern raptors.

## Key Behaviors

Thornback Raptors hunt in coordinated packs of 4-8 individuals using sophisticated stalking and psychological tactics. They remain just beyond prey's perception, using vocalizations to unnerve and create mental disorientation. The creatures are genuinely intelligent and capable of mimicking sounds of wounded animals or humanoids to lure prey. Packs demonstrate clear hierarchies with alpha individuals directing hunts. Young raptors are trained in pack coordination through mock hunts. The creatures are most active during twilight and night hours.

## Combat Strategy

Raptors use sound and psychological pressure to weaken prey, then attack with precision strikes. Individual raptors leap and slash with their curved claws, targeting vital areas, then withdraw to allow venom or bleeding to weaken victims. Packs coordinate flank attacks that prevent prey from engaging all threats simultaneously. The raptors avoid prolonged direct combat when possible, preferring to kill through accumulated damage and disorientation.

## Attack Methods

### Slashing Claw Strike

The raptor executes a high-speed slash with its curved hind-leg claw, designed to disembowel or sever limbs. Multiple strikes in rapid succession can create severe bleeding.

### Biting Attack

The raptor's bite is designed for precision rather than crushing, targeting exposed flesh and creating puncture wounds.

### Coordinated Pack Attack

Multiple raptors attack simultaneously from different directions, making comprehensive defense nearly impossible.

## Special Abilities

### Predatory Vocalization

Raptors emit clicking, hissing sounds that can be modulated to mimic wounded creatures. These vocalizations have genuine psychological effect on prey.

### Pack Coordination

Raptors communicate and coordinate complex hunting strategies through vocalizations and body language. Coordinated packs are exponentially more dangerous than individuals.

### Fear Stalker

Prolonged exposure to raptor hunting behavior causes cumulative psychological effects including paranoia and disorientation that impairs victim judgment.

### Surgical Precision

Raptor attacks target vital areas with remarkable accuracy, gaining advantage against exposed targets and vital points.

### Ambush Predator

Raptors are superlatively effective when attacking from cover or hidden position, gaining significant bonus to attack rolls when striking from ambush.

### Additional Information

Raptors are much less dangerous when isolated from pack support. Individual raptors tend to retreat rather than engage determined opposition. The creatures avoid well-lit areas and respond negatively to loud noise that disrupts their vocalizations. Packs that have successfully hunted humanoids become more bold in targeting humans. The creatures' scales can be harvested after death and used for armor or crafting.
